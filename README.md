* ## Welcome to CareConnect!
   * #### **[Open CareConnect](https://care-connect-health.netlify.app/)**
   * #### [CareConnect BackEnd Repo](https://github.com/techbyadi/careconnect-back-end)
   * #### Here at CareConnect our goal is to help you find the right doctor for you and your schedule when you need medical care.
     #### When first visiting our app you will be greeted with a list of doctors within our network. Also a search bar that allows you find a doctor with a particular specialty or from the symptoms your are experiencing, as well as finding a doctor within your city and your daily schedule. 
     #### To schedule an appointment with any doctor you must first sign up and create an account.
     #### Once logged in you can create an appointment with the doctor within their schedule.
     #### We also keep track of the appointments you have scheduled, for you. Everyone experiences unexpected changes in their daily schedule. We give you the ability to reschedule your appointment at a time the doctor is available. If you can't make your appointment, no worry, you have the ability to cancel your appointment.
     #### Tell us about you experience after your appointment. We give you the ability to post a review about the doctor you visited, and you can even rate your exerience as well.
     #### You can view reviews other users have left on a doctor's page, to gauge if the doctor will provide the care you seek.
